### Css Reset and Normalize?
* __Reset__: All browsers have their own default styles. CSS reset cleans these styles to avoid cross-browser differences as much as possible.
* __Normalize__: It keeps the default value of browsers' style and use 'good' part of it. The advantage of this is that it less likely conficts in terms of code priority since it keeps the default styles.
